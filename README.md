**Leverage the scripts and libraries of Python version 3.7 and beyond to overcome networking and security issues**

## What is this book about?
It’s now more apparent than ever that security is a critical aspect of IT infrastructure, and that devastating data breaches can occur from simple network line hacks. As shown in this book, combining the latest version of Python with an increased focus on network security can help you to level up your defenses against cyber attacks and cyber threats.
Python is being used for increasingly advanced tasks, with the latest update introducing new libraries and packages featured in the Python 3.7.4 recommended version. Moreover, most scripts are compatible with the latest versions of Python and can also be executed in a virtual environment.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Create scripts in Python to automate security and pentesting tasks
* Explore Python programming tools that are used in network security processes
* Automate tasks such as analyzing and extracting information from servers
* Understand how to detect server vulnerabilities and analyze security modules
* Discover ways to connect to and get information from the Tor network
